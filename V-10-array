1
Explanation: The array is [2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 6, 2]. Here, the numbers 2, 3, and 6 are present twice, and the number 1 is present only once. So, the unique number in this array is 1.

(XOR OF SAME ELEMNET IS 0)
ANSWER : int findUnique(int *arr, int size)
{
    int ans = 0;

    for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
        ans=ans^arr[i];
    }
    return ans;
}
